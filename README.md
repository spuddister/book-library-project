# Book Library Project

For this project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Curriculum in the Javascript course, I built a book shelf to showcase my object oriented Javascript skills and used the Bulma CSS Framework.

### New Skills
- CSS Frameworks (Bulma)
- Further knowledge with Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors
